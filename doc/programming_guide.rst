Programming guide
=================

Getting started
+++++++++++++++

Installation of xTIMEcomposer Tools Suite
-----------------------------------------

The Serial to Ethernet application requires xTIMEcomposer version 13.0.0 or greater. It can be downloaded at the following URL http://www.xmos.com/support/xtools

Import and build procedure using xTIMEcomposer studio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install the software, open the xTIMEcomposer (v13.0.0 or later) and follow these steps:

#. Open the xTIMEcomposer studio and ensure that it is operating in online mode.

#. Open the *XMOS Edit* perspective (Window -> Open Perspective -> XMOS Edit).

#. Open the xSOFTip view from (Window -> Show View -> xSOFTip). An xSOFTip window appears on the bottom-left.

#. Find the `Serial to Ethernet bridging application` in the listed software blocks

#. Click and drag it into the Project Explorer window. Doing this will open an Import xTIMEcomposer Software window.

#. Click on Finish to download and complete the import.

#. This will also automatically import dependencies for this application.

#. The application is called as *app_serial_to_ethernet* in the *Project Explorer* window.

Build the ``serial to ethernet`` application:

#. Click on the *app_serial_to_ethernet* item in the *Project Explorer* window.

#. Click on the *Build* (indicated by a 'Hammer' picture) icon.

#. Check the *Console* window to verify that the application has built successfully.

Flash the web pages and device configuration
--------------------------------------------

To flash the web pages and device configuration using xTIMEcomposer studio:

#. In the *Project Explorer* window, locate the *app_serial_to_ethernet.xe* and *web_data.bin* in the (app_serial_to_ethernet -> bin).

#. Right click on *app_serial_to_ethernet.xe* and click on (Flash As -> Flash Configurations...).

#. In the *Flash Configurations* window, double click the *xCORE Application* to create a new flash configuration.

#. Navigate to *XFlash Options* tab and apply the following settings:

   * Check *Boot partition size (bytes):* and its value as 0x10000
   * *Other XFlash Options:* as ``--data bin/web_data.bin``
   
#. Click on *Apply* and then *Flash* to the XMOS device.

#. Check the *Console* window to verify flashing progress.


Building from command line tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build from the command line, navigate to `app_serial_to_ethernet` directory and execute the command::

       xmake all

Inorder to build the firmware with a static IP (say 169.254.196.178), execute the following command::

       xmake all STATIC_IP=169.254.196.178


To flash the application, configration and web pages, execute the command::

    xmake flash

Source code structure
+++++++++++++++++++++

Directory structure
-------------------

The source code is split into application source code and web pages.
The application builds into a single executable using the source code from the modules. 
The modules used by an application are specified using the ``USED_MODULES`` variable in
the application Makefile. 

The source package contains:

.. list-table:: 
 :header-rows: 1

 * - Directory
   - Description
 * - src
   - Source files that implement application functionality
 * - web
   - Web (html) pages used by the web server module
 * - images
   - Images that are displayed on the web (html) pages
   
Supported modules originate from other repositories:

.. list-table:: 
 :header-rows: 1

 * - Directory
   - Description
   - Repository
 * - module_mii_singlethread
   - Lite version of low level ethernet interface over MII
   - sc_ethernet
 * - module_ethernet_smi
   - A library code to communicate with ethernet phy using the SMI protocol
   - sc_ethernet
 * - module_xtcp
   - XTCP TCP/IP stack
   - sc_xtcp
 * - module_multi_uart
   - Multiple UART TX server and RX server
   - sc_multi_uart
 * - module_xc_ptr
   - A library to allow XC code to access pointers via inline assembly calls.
   - sc_util
 * - module_website
   - Embedded website component
   - sc_website
 * - module_mutual_thread_comm
   - A protocol that allows two cores to communicate
   - sc_util
   
Key files
---------

.. list-table::
 :header-rows: 1

 * - File
   - Description
 * - ``xtcp_client_conf.h``
   - Header file for clients of the TCP/IP stack.
 * - ``udp_discovery.h``
   - Header file for declaring UDP port, firmware version and function declarations required for s2e device discovery
 * - ``uart_config.h``

Notes on application interfaces
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This section provides a brief description on main application interfaces.

UART configuration
------------------

The initialisation and configuration process for both the RX and TX operations is the same. The files ``multi_uart_tx_conf.h`` and ``multi_uart_rx_conf.h`` are used to configure multiUART TX and RX servers for the default values. For application configuration, the function :c:func:`uart_config_init` is used to apply configuration stored from flash or to use default application defined static configuration. The function :c:func:`uart_set_config` is utilised whenever there is a dynamic configuration change request (i.e. a particular UART reconfiguration request). The flow is visualised in :ref:`fig_uart_init_flow`.

Webserver
---------

The webserver handles all HTTP requests from the web clients. A web client may request to change UART settings, save current settings, or apply the previously saved UART seetings etc. Webserver identifies these requests, validates them and services those requests. It calls appropriate UART handler api's to retrieve and set channel settings. For example, for a 'Set' request from the web page, the webserver handler utilizes website component in order to parse the form data from web page, the required UART parameters are extracted and the UART_Handler's uart_set_config api is called to set the new UART configuration.

The Webserver interface utilises *sc_website* component to implement web server functionality. Refer to the `Quickstart Guide` within `Documentation` or `Developer Column` of the ``Slicekit GPIO and Ethernet Combo Demo`` example in xSOFTip browser. This documentation contains more information on how to utilize the ``Embedded Webserver Function Library`` component in customizing web server applications.

Flash interface
---------------

The s2e_flash core handles data to/from flash fitted on board. The UART configuration web (html) pages, UART settings and IP configuration are typically stored into flash. Web pages are retrieved upon request from the client to the web server. UART settings can be 'saved' and 'restored' from flash. They are usually done via:
    * Request from web page (HTTP request)
    * From Telnet configuration server
    * Upon startup (to restore restore last saved settings)
    
IP configuration is saved via UDP server request and is requested from flash upon start-up.
