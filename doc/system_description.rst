    Core usage
    
In order to achieve the desired data bridging, this application essentially maps each of the configured UART to a telnet socket and maintains application buffers (FIFOs) for each of such mapping. Whenever there is any UART data available, the `UART Handler` core fills the appropriate UART Rx buffer (MultiUART Rx Server) and notifies `TCP Handler` logical core to consume this data. Similarly whenever there is any Ethernet data from `Layer 2 Ethernet MAC/MII`, `Etherent/TCP Server` logical core notifies `TCP Handler` core, which acts as a TCP client about data availability. `TCP Handler` stores this data into respective application buffers. This data is then consumed by `UART handler` and then pushed to `UART Tx ports` by `MultiUART(TX server)` logical core.

Cores
~~~~~

The design uses seven logical cores as described below.

 #. The `MultiUART` component comprises two logical cores, one acting as a transmit (TX) server for up to 8 UARTs, and the other acting as a receive (RX) server for up to 8 UARTs.

 #. `UART_handler` is an application core that interfaces with the `multiUART RX and TX servers`. It handles UART configuration requests, facilitates to store the UART data received from `multiUART RX server` into respective application buffers and transfers the data received from TCP clients to `multiUART TX server`.

 #. `TCP_Handler` is another application core that initializes and manages the application. It interfaces with the `Flash_handler` for UART configuration storage and recovery, handles all the xtcp application events (application data and UI configuration requests) received from the `Ethernet/TCP server` module. UDP discovery management, web server handling, telnet data extraction are all implemented in this logical core.

 #. The `Ethertnet/TCP server` runs on a single logical core and connects to the `Layer 2 Ethernet MAC` component which uses a single logical core. It uses XC channel to communicate to clients (`TCP_Handler` in this case) using XTCP events. 

 #. The `Flash_handler` core handles flash data sotrage and retrieval requests from `TCP_handler` core based on the application dynamics such as start-up or UI driven requests.

Buffering
~~~~~~~~~

 #. Buffering for the TX server is managed by the `UART_handler` Core. Data is transferred to the `multiUART TX` logical core via a shared memory interface.

 #. There is no buffering provided by the UART RX server. The `UART_handler` core is able to respond to the received data in real time and store them in buffer(s) available in the  `TCP_handler` core via token notifcations.

Communication model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 #. The ``sc_multi_uart`` module utilises a combination of shared memory and channel communication. Channel communication is used on both the RX and TX servers to pause the logical core and subsequently release the logical core when required for reconfiguration. The primary means of data transfer for both the `multiUART RX and TX` logical cores is via shared memory. The RX logical core utilises a channel to notify any client (`UART_handler` in this case) of available data - this means that events can be utilised within an application to avoid the requirement for polling for received data.

 #. `Ethernet/TCP` module and `Flash_handler` core connects to `TCP_handler` client using their repective XC channels.
